 Challenge 2 by Tyler Shubert
This program uses a exisint .CSV file containing data provided by loan providers; and is able to acccept user input of their personal information to determin the elligability for their loan application.
If the user is elegible for a loan, the program then gives the option to save the qualifed loan data to a .CSV file at the location of their choice. 
The CSV file used to initially run the application is contained in the "data" folder included. The program will ask for the location of the file when run. This allows for a reguarly updated list from loan providers to be easily used.
